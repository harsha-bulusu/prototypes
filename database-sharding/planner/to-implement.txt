Consistent Hashing
Rebalancing
Tracing Hotspots
Failovers && replication

ðŸ§ª What You Can Prototype:

Simulate adding/removing shards, and track rebalance cost

Implement a ConsistentHashRing class

Add fault simulation: what happens if one shard fails?

--> Implement Database migration step for hot shard problem
