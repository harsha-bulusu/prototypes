## 🧩 Real-World Use Cases of Partitioning

---

### 🔷 1. **Vertical Partitioning**

#### ✅ Definition Recap:

Splits a table **by columns** across different tables or databases.

#### 🏢 **Used When:**

* Different columns are accessed by different parts of the system.
* Some columns are rarely used (e.g., profile picture, settings).
* You want to isolate sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens).
* You want to keep frequently used data in memory.

---

### 💼 Real Use Cases:

#### 📌 **E-commerce (Amazon, Flipkart)**

* **Orders Table:**

  * Frequently accessed fields: `order_id`, `user_id`, `status`
  * Rarely accessed: `shipping_address`, `gift_message`, `return_reason`

➡ Split into:

* `orders_main`: for fast queries
* `orders_meta`: infrequent fields

#### 📌 **Banking Systems**

* Separate user credentials (`username`, `password_hash`) from profile (`address`, `KYC documents`).
* One service can manage auth, while another manages user info — **microservice-aligned**.

#### 📌 **Instagram / Facebook**

* `user_auth`: contains email, password
* `user_profile`: bio, avatar
* `user_activity`: last login, online status

#### 📌 **Analytics Platforms**

* Split raw logs into:

  * `event_core`: event\_id, timestamp, user\_id
  * `event_details`: JSON blob, metadata

### ✅ Benefits of Vertical Partitioning:

| Benefit               | Why it Matters                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Better cache locality | Fewer columns in hot path = faster queries |
| Security isolation    | Auth info stored separately                |
| Team ownership        | Separate teams can own separate tables     |
| Performance           | Smaller table size = faster I/O            |

### 🔶 2. **Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding)**

#### ✅ Definition Recap:

Splits a table **by rows**, each subset handled independently.

#### 🏢 **Used When:**

* Tables are huge (millions or billions of rows).
* Need to scale writes/reads.
* Want to geographically distribute data (data sovereignty).
* Avoid single-node bottlenecks.

---

### 💼 Real Use Cases:

#### 📌 **Instagram**

* `users` table:

  * Shard by user\_id (range or hash)
* `posts`, `likes`, `comments`:

  * Shard by user\_id or post\_id
* Helps to isolate high-traffic users

#### 📌 **Uber / Ola**

* `ride_requests`:

  * Shard by region or city (geo-partition)
  * Eg: Mumbai data in `shard_mum`, Delhi in `shard_del`
* Scales with demand and improves latency

#### 📌 **YouTube**

* `videos` table sharded by `video_id`
* `views`, `comments`, `likes` linked to the same shard
* Each shard handles a subset of the content

#### 📌 **Banking (Core Banking Systems)**

* Customers are sharded by account number prefix or region.
* Enables concurrent operations on different customer groups.

#### 📌 **Multi-tenant SaaS Apps (e.g., Salesforce, Notion)**

* Each tenant (company) gets a separate shard
* Makes migration, backup, isolation easier

### ✅ Benefits of Horizontal Partitioning:

| Benefit          | Why it Matters                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Scalability      | You can add more shards as data grows       |
| Isolation        | One shard crashing doesn’t affect others    |
| Parallelism      | Multiple shards = parallel query processing |
| Lower contention | Less lock contention during writes          |

## ⚖️ Summary: When to Use What?

| Criterion                        | Vertical Partitioning | Horizontal Partitioning |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Table grows in **columns**       | ✅                     | ❌                       |
| Table grows in **rows**          | ❌                     | ✅                       |
| Want to isolate **data domains** | ✅                     | ❌                       |
| Want to distribute **load**      | ❌                     | ✅                       |
| Microservice-aligned storage     | ✅                     | ✅                       |
| Scale read/write throughput      | ⚠️ Limited            | ✅ Scalable              |
