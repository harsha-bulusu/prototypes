Consistent Hashing
Rebalancing
Tracing Hotspots
Failovers && replication

ðŸ§ª What You Can Prototype:
Weâ€™ll build on your existing Python setup:

Add a new DirectoryShardManager that uses a central map (dict/JSON) for routing

Simulate adding/removing shards, and track rebalance cost

Implement a ConsistentHashRing class

Add fault simulation: what happens if one shard fails?
