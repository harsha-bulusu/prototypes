Perfect. Here’s a **1-week structured, in-depth learning plan** to master **Database Sharding** — from the roots to advanced concepts — with **theory + hands-on prototyping + intuition-building comparisons**.

---

### 🔥 Week Goal:

Build deep intuition around **why**, **how**, and **when** to shard databases, and prototype a minimal sharded system to internalize concepts like range/hash sharding, lookup services, consistency, and rebalancing.

---

## 🗓️ **Day-by-Day Plan**

---

### ✅ **Day 1: Foundation — Why Partition? Why Shard?**

#### 📚 Concepts:

* What is **Database Partitioning**?
* Difference between **horizontal partitioning (sharding)** and **vertical partitioning**
* Evolution:

  * Monolith → Vertical scaling → Replication → Partitioning → Sharding
* Problems solved by sharding:

  * Query performance
  * Write throughput
  * Data distribution
  * Storage limits
* Trade-offs: **complexity vs scalability**

#### 📓 Terms to Learn:

* Partition Key
* Shard Key
* Logical vs Physical Partition
* Hotspotting
* Rebalancing
* Global Secondary Index

#### 🧠 Exercise:

* Draw the evolution chart: monolithic → replicated → partitioned → sharded

---

### ✅ **Day 2: Deep Dive into Horizontal vs Vertical Partitioning**

#### 📚 Concepts:

* **Vertical Partitioning**: Split by columns (e.g., user profile vs user auth)
* **Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding)**: Split by rows (e.g., user\_id 1-10K, 10K-20K…)

#### 🧪 Practical:

* Use SQLite:

  * Create a vertical partition (separate DBs for login & profile)
  * Create horizontal partitions (user data split by ID ranges)

#### 🧠 Intuition Task:

* Think of a real system (e.g., Instagram) — what could be horizontally partitioned vs vertically?

---

### ✅ **Day 3: Sharding Strategies**

#### 📚 Concepts:

* **Range-based sharding**
* **Hash-based sharding**
* **Directory-based (lookup service)**
* **Geo-sharding**
* Pros/cons of each
* What happens during lookup, insert, rebalance?

#### 🧪 Prototype:

* In Python:

  * Implement a `ShardManager` with:

    * Range-based shard logic
    * Hash-based logic
    * CRUD dispatcher to simulated DB shards (dicts/files)
  * Log the routing decisions for each op

#### 🧠 Comparison:

* Why Cassandra uses consistent hashing
* Why MongoDB supports range and hashed sharding

---

### ✅ **Day 4: Shard Key Design + Routing**

#### 📚 Concepts:

* Choosing a good shard key
* Avoiding hotspots
* Composite keys
* Shard-aware clients
* Query fan-out and scatter-gather

#### 🧪 Prototype:

* Enhance yesterday’s `ShardManager` to:

  * Handle bad shard keys (e.g., timestamps)
  * Log skewed writes/reads
  * Print how many shards a query touches

#### 🧠 Exercise:

* Compare: MongoDB vs MySQL sharding
* Why queries like `ORDER BY`, `JOIN` suffer across shards?

---

### ✅ **Day 5: Consistency, Availability, and Coordination**

#### 📚 Concepts:

* CAP theorem applied to sharding
* Cross-shard transactions
* Two-phase commit (2PC)
* Global secondary indexes
* Rebalancing and data migration
* Failover and replica awareness

#### 🧪 Prototype:

* Simulate a 2PC with 2 shards and a coordinator
* Use logging to simulate commit/rollback

#### 🧠 Compare:

* MongoDB’s config servers
* CockroachDB’s distributed transaction model

---

### ✅ **Day 6: Rebalancing + Fault Tolerance**

#### 📚 Concepts:

* What happens when a shard is full?
* Manual vs automatic rebalancing
* Chunk migration
* Lookup service update issues
* Fault tolerance and replica promotion

#### 🧪 Prototype:

* Manually split a shard into 2 and redistribute
* Simulate stale routing via a local “cache”

#### 🧠 Exercise:

* Discuss: When do you reshard? When do you redesign the key?
* Compare: Vitess re-sharding, Cassandra token ring

---

### ✅ **Day 7: Real-World Systems + Review**

#### 📚 Systems to Study:

* **MongoDB**: Hashed/Range, Config Servers
* **Cassandra**: Consistent Hashing, Token Ring
* **Vitess**: Query rewriting + MySQL sharding
* **HBase**: Region servers
* **DynamoDB**: Internal partitioning, consistent performance

#### 🧪 Task:

* Pick any one system (MongoDB or Cassandra) and:

  * Read architecture
  * Write routing logic simulating their sharding model
  * Evaluate write path & read path

#### 🎯 Wrap-Up Task:

* Create a mind map or blog-style summary: "How to Think Like a Sharded Database"
* Include: shard key rules, routing logic, rebalance steps, trade-offs

## 🧰 Tools You’ll Use

* Python (for simulations)
* SQLite or files for simulating storage
* Diagrams.net for system drawings
* Optional: Docker MongoDB cluster or Cassandra (advanced bonus)
